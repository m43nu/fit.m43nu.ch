Today is restday. If you want to move try some active recovery:<br/>
Go for a walk, meditate, stretch, swim, sauna, etc.

If you need some simple inspiration for your restday - here is a sample from [James Newburys Working In](https://app.sugarwod.com/marketplace/ultra-instinct/working-in):

**Ultra Breath Ratio**<br/>
1-1-2-1 for 12min<br/>
Repeat your chosen times for 12min straight, start with:<br/>
4sec inhale - 4sec hold - 8sec exhale - 4sec hold - repeat.<br/>
If you're familiar with this kind of breathing work you can adjust:<br/>
5sec inhale - 5sec hold - 10sec exhale - 5sec hold - repeat.<br/>
6 - 6 - 12 - 6, ect.

**40min stretch**<br/>
Stretch as passive as possible into all your favourite positions.<br/>
If you are struggling with finding positions, I recommend you to follow [ROMWOD](https://romwod.com/).

**Get yourself some rest. Keep your body and MIND healthy.**
