20min of Tabata.

**METCON: All the Tabatas (each round: 4min, 20sec on, 10sec off)**<br/>
* Shadow Boxing
* Sit Ups
* Burpees
* Lunges
* Push Ups

*Notes*<br/>
One Tabata is 4min - 20sec work and 10 sec rest.<br/>
Finish one exercise before moving to the next one.<br/>
If you have a bag, work on the bag instead of shadow boxing.

**20 days of quarantine WODs. I'll keep them coming until we're out of it!**
