Inspired by "Death by Burpees" [COMPTRAIN](https://comptrain.co/home-gym/) and the core-piece is from Freeletics Gym.

**EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute)**<br/>
25 Air Punches<br/>
3 + (1-2-3-4-5-etc.) Burpees<br/>
*Notes*<br/>
Burpees: Start with 3 reps, add 1 rep each round until you can't make it under one minute.<br/>
Air Punches: each hand counts, use bag if available<br/>
Scale the numbers so you can do around 8-10 rounds.

**CORE**<br/>
25 - 20 - 15 - 10 - 5<br/>
Plate Situps<br/>
Plate Cocoons<br/>
*Notes*<br/>
Workout goes: 25 Situps, 25 Cocoons, 20 Situps, 20 Cocoons, and so on.<br/>
Use a 5kg plate if available, but any weight will do (or just a frisbee, a glove, your cat...)<br/>

**Enjoy!**
