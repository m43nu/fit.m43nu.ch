Some quality work from [TheProgrm](https://theprogrm.com/) and a short but intense capacity test.

**10 Rounds for Quality**<br/>

10 [Tuck Ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obVuc0wZoss)<br/>
10 [Cossack Squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvxmS5BIPi8)<br/>

**For Time**<br/>
100 [Burpees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auBLPXO8Fww)

*Notes*<br/>
I know here are a lot of Burpees these days, but they are just great for our bodies :)<br/>
so try to go as fast as possible. Always touch the ground with your chest, push ups are not required (or useful).
I got 6:38 - some motivation for you ;)<br/>

**Log your time for the burpees. We'll de do this again.**
