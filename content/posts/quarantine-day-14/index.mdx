Today is restday. If you want to move try some active recovery.

If you need some more inspiration for your restday - once again a sample from [James Newburys Working In](https://app.sugarwod.com/marketplace/ultra-instinct/working-in):

**AM: Ultra Breath Ratio**<br/>
1-1-2-1 for 9min<br/>
Repeat your chosen times for 9min straight, start with:<br/>
4sec inhale - 4sec hold - 8sec exhale - 4sec hold - repeat.<br/>
If you're familiar with this kind of breathing work you can adjust:<br/>
5sec inhale - 5sec hold - 10sec exhale - 5sec hold - repeat.<br/>
6 - 6 - 12 - 6, ect.<br/>
Do more than last week.

**Do you!**<br/>
Movies, Beach, Walk, Netflix and Chill, Hot Tea and Read a Book.

**PM: Ultra Breath Ratio 2**<br/>
1-4-2 for 9min<br/>

**Stay strong.**
